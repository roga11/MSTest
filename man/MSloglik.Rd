\title{Markov-switching loglikelihood and Hamilton smoother}
\usage{
MSloglik(theta, mdl, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{theta}{vector with mean and variance in each regime.}

\item{mdl}{List containing relevant parameters.}

\item{k}{number of regimes. Must be greater than or equal to 2.}

\item{P}{matrix with transition probabilities.}

\item{pinf}{limiting probabilities of each regime.}
}
\value{
List with log-likelihood (loglik), and smoothed probabilities of each regime (xi_t_T).
}
\description{
This function computes loglikelihood for Markov-switching models and computes the hamilton smoother.
