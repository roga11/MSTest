\item{k1}{integer specifying the number of regimes under the alternative hypothesis.}

\item{N}{integer specifying the number of replications.}

\item{burnin}{integer specifying the number of observations to drop from beginning of simulation.}

\item{mdl_h1_control}{List with controls/options used to estimate unrestricted model.}

\item{workers}{Integer determining the number of workers to use for parallel computing version of test. Note that parallel pool must already be open.}
