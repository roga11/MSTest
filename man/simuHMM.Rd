\title{Simulate Hidden Markov model with normally distributed errors}
\usage{
simuHMM(mdl_h0, burnin = 100L)
}
\arguments{
\item{mdl_h0:}{List containing the following DGP parameters
- n: length of series
- k: number of regimes
- mu: (k x q) vector of means 
- sigma: (q x q) covariance matrix. If simulating a univariate process (i.e., length of mu is 1), this should be the standard devation and not the variance.
- P: (k x k) transition matrix (columns must sum to one)}

\item{burnin:}{number of simulated observations to remove from beginning. Default is 100}
}
\value{
List with simulated series and its DGP parameters
}
\description{
This function simulates a Hidden Markov Model process
}
