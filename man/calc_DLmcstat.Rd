\title{Calculate combined p-value test statistic}
\usage{
calc_DLmcstat(ezt, N, params, type = "min")
}
\arguments{
\item{ezt}{observed series}

\item{N}{total number of test statistics (i.e. simulated + observed = N)}

\item{param}{output from \emph{approxDist} which obtains the parameters needed in eq. 16 which is used for 
combining p-values.}
}
\value{
The four test statistics (eq. 11 - 14 in paper)
}
\description{
This function computes test-statistics for observed and simulated samples. 
It begins by calculating it for the obsted data, then generates test-statistics from 
simulated data to approximate null distribution and then calculates the p-values and 
combines them according to eq. 17 or 18 of Dufour & Luger (2017).
