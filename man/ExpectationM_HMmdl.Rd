\title{Hidden Markov model log-likelihood function}
\usage{
ExpectationM_HMmdl(theta, mdl, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{theta}{vector of model parameters}

\item{mdl}{List with model attributes}

\item{k}{integer determining the number of regimes}
}
\value{
log-likelihood given data

List with log-likelihood (log-likelihood), and smoothed probabilities of each regime (xi_t_T).
}
\description{
This function computes the log-likelihood for a Hidden MArkov model and uses the Hamilton smoother to obtain smoothed probabilities of each state. This is also the expectation step in the Expectation Maximization algorithm for a Markov-switching autoregressive model.
