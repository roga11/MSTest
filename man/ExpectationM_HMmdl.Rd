\title{Hidden Markov model log-likelihood function}
\usage{
ExpectationM_HMmdl(theta, mdl, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{\code{theta}}{Vector of model parameters.}

\item{\code{mdl}}{List with model attributes.}

\item{\code{k}}{Integer determining the number of regimes.}
}
\value{
List which includes log-likelihood value and smoothed probabilities of each regime.
}
\description{
This function computes the log-likelihood for a Hidden Markov model and uses the Hamilton smoother to obtain smoothed probabilities of each state. This is also the expectation step in the Expectation Maximization algorithm for a Markov-switching autoregressive model.
