\title{Combine p-values}
\usage{
combine_stat(s0, sN, params, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{\code{s0}}{A (\code{4 x 1}) vector with four moment-based test statistic under from observed data.}

\item{\code{sN}}{A (\code{N x 4}) matrix with \code{N} different simulated moment-based test statistics.}

\item{\code{param}}{A (\code{2 x 4}) matrix with parameters to combine test statistics. See \code{\link{approxDistDL}}.}

\item{\code{type}}{String determining the type of method used to combine p-values. If set to "min" the min method of combining p-values 
is used as in Fisher 1932 and Pearson 1933. If set to "prod" the product of p-values is used as in Tippett 1931 and Wilkinson 1951.}
}
\value{
A (\code{N+1 x 1}) vector with test statistics. The last element is the test statistc from observed data.
}
\description{
This function is used to combine the four moment-based p-values as in eq. \code{17} and \code{18} of Dufour & Luger 2017.
