\title{Combine p-values}
\usage{
combine_stat(s0, sN, params, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{s0}{test-statistic under the alternative}

\item{sN}{test-statistics under the null}

\item{type}{the type of method used to combine p-values. If set to "min" the min method of combining p-values is used as in Fisher (1932) 
and Pearson (1933). If set to "prod" the product of p-values is used as in Tippett (1931) 
and Wilkinson (1951).}

\item{param}{output from \emph{approxDist} which obtains the parameters needed in eq. 16 which is used for 
combining p-values.}

\item{N}{total number of test statistics (i.e. simulated + observed = N)}
}
\value{
The four test statistics (eq. 11 - 14 in paper)
}
\description{
This function is used to combine the p-values as in eq 17 and 18 of Dufour & Luger (2017).
The input parameter \emph{type} can be used to used to specify the method for combining 
the pvalues. If set to "min" the min method of combining p-values is used as in Fisher (1932) 
and Pearson (1933). If set to "prod" the product of p-values is used as in Tippett (1931) 
and Wilkinson (1951).
