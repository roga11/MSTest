\title{Vector autoregressive moment grid}
\usage{
argrid_MSVARmdl(mu, sigma, k, ar, msmu, msvar)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{(k x q) matrix of means in each regime (for k regimes and q time series)}

\item{k}{integer determining the number of regimes}

\item{ar}{number of autoregressive lags}

\item{msmu}{boolean indicator. If 'TRUE' mean is subject to change. If 'FALSE' mean is constant across regimes}

\item{msvar}{boolean indicator. If 'TRUE' variance is subject to change. If 'FALSE' variance is constant across regimes}

\item{sig}{list with k regime specific (q x q) covariance matrices}
}
\value{
List with M regime specific (q x k) matrices of means, List with M regime specific covariance matrices, and vector indicating the corresponded 1,..., k regime.
}
\description{
Creates grid of means and covariance matrices consistent  with a Markov-switching vector autoregressive model.
