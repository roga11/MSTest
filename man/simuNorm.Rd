\title{Simulate normally distributed process}
\usage{
simuNorm(mdl_h0)
}
\arguments{
\item{mdl_h0:}{List containing the following DGP parameters
- n: length of series
- mu: (q x 1) vector of means 
- sigma: (q x q) covariance matrix. If simulating a univariate process (i.e., length of mu is 1), this should be the standard devation and not the variance.}
}
\value{
List with simulated series and its DGP parameters
}
\description{
This function simulates a normally distributed process
}
