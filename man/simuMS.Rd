\title{Simulate Markov-switching  Series}
\usage{
simuMS(mdl_h0, type = "markov", burnin = 200L)
}
\arguments{
\item{mdl_h0}{List containing series properties such as n: length, ar: number of autoregressive lags, 
stdev: standard deviation, mu: mean of process, phi: vector of autoregressive coefficients, P: transition matrix (if type="markov")
or vector of component weights (if type="mixture"), k: number of regimes.}

\item{type}{determines type of St is a Markov process or a random mixture. Default is "markov"}

\item{burnin}{number of simulated observations to remove from beginning. By assumption, series begins in state 1 
so it is recommended to use burnin to avoid dependence on this assumption. Default is 200.}
}
\value{
List with Markov-switching series and its properties
}
\description{
This function simulates a Markov-switching  series
}
