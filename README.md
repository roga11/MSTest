# MSTest

This package implements hypothesis testing procedures that can be used to identify the number of regimes in a Markov-Switching model. It includes the methods proposed in Hansen (1992), Carrasco et al. (2014), Dufour & Luger (2017), Kasahara & Shimotsu (2018) and Dufour & Rodriguez Rondon (2022).

Currently, this package is only available through github. To install it you can use the following (requires 'devtools' package): 
devtools::install_github("roga11/MSTest")
