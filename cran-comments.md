## Submission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Made changes to MMC LRT related functions for obtaining null distribution of statistical test.
* Added more examples. Examples that take long to complete are commented out but serve to get familiar with usage. 
* Fixed bug related to using init_theta (setting initial values of parameters) when estimating Markov models (i.e. MSARmdl(), HMmdl(), and MSVARmdl()). 
* Fixed bug in MMC_bound() when k0>1
* updated `DESCRIPTION` file for new version.
